			<h1>Planets of our Solar System</h1>

				There are more planets than stars in our galaxy. The current
				count orbiting our star: eight. The inner, rocky planets are
				Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. NASA's newest rover —
				Perseverance — landed on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021. The outer
				planets are gas giants Jupiter and Saturn and ice giants
				Uranus and Neptune. Beyond Neptune, a newer class of smaller
				worlds called dwarf planets reign, including longtime
				favorite Pluto. Thousands more planets have been discovered
				beyond our solar system. Scientists call them exoplanets
				(exo means "from outside").

			<h1>Real-Time, Real Data: Your Galactic Neighborhood</h1>

				The key difference between a planet and a dwarf planet is
				the kinds of objects that share its orbit around the Sun.
				Pluto, for example, has not cleared its orbit of similar
				objects while Earth or Jupiter have no similarly-sized
				worlds on the same path around the Sun. Like planets, dwarf
				planets are generally round (Haumea looks like an
				overinflated football) and orbit the Sun.
				<br />
				There are likely thousands of dwarf planets waiting to be
				discovered beyond Neptune. The five best-known dwarf planets
				are Ceres, Pluto, Makemake, Haumea, and Eris. Except for
				Ceres, which lies in the main asteroid belt, these small
				worlds are located in the Kuiper Belt. They’re considered
				dwarfs because they are massive, round, and orbit the Sun,
				but haven't cleared their orbital path.
				<br>
				This snapshot focuses on active NASA missions and select ESA missions. Showcasing the entire operating
				international fleet is too much of a data wallop at the moment (but we are working on it!). Active
				international missions such as Japan's Akatsuki Venus Orbiter and ESA and Japan's Mercury-bound
				BepiColombo are not yet available.

				Use the HD button to upload higher-resolution imagery of the planets. It may not work properly on older
				mobile devices. Have fun, and keep exploring.
